title: Scoring Chance Trends and Goaltending Performance
date: 2023-06-28

Goaltending is voodoo. It’s a phrase that is thrown around in hockey circles, regardless of if the focus is on advanced analytics, or based on people strictly using the eye test. It gets boiled down to a relatively simple fact; goaltending performance in the NHL is inconsistent year-to-year. A classic example that often gets brought up is the curious case of Carter Hart. Hart, the first goalie taken in the 2016 NHL draft, broke into the league as a 20-year-old, and put up a 16-13-1 record on a .917 save percentage in 31 games played. The next year, Hart played in 43 games, amassing 24 wins on his way to a .914 save percentage and 2.42 goals against average. By all traditional measurement standards, the Flyers had found a starting goalie before he even turned 23. However, what happened after the 2019-2020 season, as the world returned from a significant sport interruption, is where things took a turn. Looking at the graph below, you’ll first see Hart’s goals saved above expected (GSAE), a measure which tells us how a goaltender performs relative to a league average goaltender. In simplest terms, each shot a goalie faces is given an expected goal value (for example, a certain shot that goes in on average 10% of the time, is given an expected goal value of 0.1 goals). If you stop more than you’re expected to, your GSAE is positive. Stop less than you’re expected to, and you find yourself in the negative quickly.

What we see from Hart’s chart tells us a few stories. First, maybe his first two seasons in the league were closer to average than exceptional, and second, what exactly happened in 2021 and 2022? The first question is a little easier to answer. In each of his five seasons, Carter Hart has ranked 38th, 15th, 66th, 57th, and 22nd in goals saved above expected amongst goalies who played at least 500 minutes. GSAE is however a cumulative statistic, influenced by the number of games a goaltender plays. When you convert Hart’s GSAE into a per game metric, his rankings become 37th, 17th, 64th, 48th, and 28th, which are different, but not that different. No matter which way you look at it, Hart’s first two seasons were objectively pretty good, especially for a first- and second-year goalie who hadn’t turned 23 yet. So what happened in 2021 and 2022? To understand this, we need to take a deeper look into NHL shooting trends.

**Understanding scoring chances**

Over the last five years, NHL teams have become more efficient scorers. More goals are going in on fewer shots, which makes it look like goaltenders are playing worse. What is actually happening is a little more complicated than this. Let’s start with the graph below:

With the exception of the 2021 season, NHL teams have been consistently averaging between 29-30 shots per game. What’s changed has been the significant decrease in low danger shots that teams have been taking over the last six years. Combine that with some fluctuations in high danger chances, and a pretty healthy jump in medium danger chances in the past two seasons, and it’s quickly easy to see that teams are taking smarter shots. Naturally, a medium danger shot sounds scarier than a low danger shot, but just how much more value is a medium danger shot over a low danger shot? Let’s look at how goaltenders have handled each shot type over the past six years.

Over the last six years, goaltenders have stopped around 90% of medium danger shots, while stopping over 96% of low danger ones. On average, you’d have to take 2.73 low danger shots in order to score as much as you would get from one medium danger shot. Now it’s obviously not that simple – in order for a low danger shot to go in, something a little strange has probably happened. It may have hit a defender on the way to the net, or the goalie lost sight of the puck when a player skated in front of them, or even simpler, the goalie made a bad mistake. Ultimately, it’s likely that even though the average is 2.73 shots, you probably need a quite a few more low danger shot attempts to account for what’s happening on medium danger shots. 
Now let’s turn back to Carter Hart and see if we can begin to pull apart what has happened with him now that we have a little more information. Here is Hart’s performance, broken up by shot type over his career.

Comparing Hart’s scoring type breakdown shows us something pretty quickly. If we take out his 2021 season (more on this shortly), we find that Hart hovers at or below average on low and medium danger shots. We also find that Hart is most valuable on high danger shots, the ones which have gone in 18.5% of the time against average NHLers over the last six seasons. In 2023, Hart stopped just under 84% of high danger chances, while the Flyers gave up 9.4 of them per game (24th most amongst goalies in the NHL). For reference, only two goalies who played the same amount as Hart, faced more high danger shots per game and performed better. Those two are named Ilya Sorokin and Juuse Saros (Both Saros and Sorokin averaged .2 or less high danger shots per game compared with Hart).  
So what happened in 2021 then? Was it a random blip, a complicated post-pandemic season, or was there something more? Let’s take another step deeper into goaltending analytics to find out.

**The Danger Ratio and Total Danger**

As we’ve come to see, not all shots are created equal. Some are obviously much more difficult to deal with. What we haven’t yet looked at is just how much more difficult some goalies have it than others. One way of comparing goaltending difficulty is by looking at the expected goals a goalie faces. Another way to look at it, and the way I think tells an interesting story, is by looking at a goaltender’s “Danger Ratio”, and in turn, the “Total Danger” they face per game. Neither of these are complicated. The danger ratio combines high danger and medium danger shots and divides it by low danger shots. A goaltender with a danger ratio closer to 1 faces roughly the same amount of low danger shots as he does high and medium danger, while a goalie with a danger ratio near 2 faces twice the amount of difficult shots compared to low danger ones. For example, Logan Thompson and Adin Hill had the third and fourth lowest danger ratio in the NHL this past season, a testament to Vegas’ defensive abilities. We can then take this one step further and multiply the Danger Ratio by the goaltender’s shots against per game, giving us the Total Danger value. Total Danger scores take into account not only shot type, but also shot volume. Higher shot volume against typically means that a team is spending more time in their defensive zone, which I would argue (albeit without the best support) is more dangerous for a goaltender. When we look at Total Danger across the league in 2023, we find Ducks goalies, Anthony Stolarz and John Gibson at the top of the list, with Juuse Saros not too far behind. For those of us who had the pleasure of watching the Ducks and Predators play this year, these numbers start making a lot of sense. The top 10 goalies who experienced the most Total Danger from this past season are found below. Notably, none of the teams these goalies played for made the playoffs. In fact, when looking at goalies who faced the most Total Danger, you have to look all the way down to Stuart Skinner at rank 25 for a starting goalie on a playoff team. (Alex Lyon was the 11th, though he only played 893 minutes).

Now once again, let’s turn back to Carter Hart. Can Total Danger explain what happened to him in 2021? In 2020, Hart had a Total Danger of 34.5 per game. In 2021, this jumps 4.5 points to 39, and is mostly explained by the fact that he faced 2 more high danger shots per game than the season before. Hart goes from facing the 58th most Total Danger per game in 2020, to the 29th most in 2021. When you take a further look into what happens to the Flyers, you also quickly find out things became a little rougher on the penalty kill. Here is the Total Danger experienced by Hart on the penalty kill over his time with the Flyers.

Hart’s Total Danger per game on the penalty kill jumped almost 50% between the 2020 season and the 2021 season. It’s jumps like these in Total Danger which both highlight that team performance has dramatically shifted, but for a young goalie, these shifts may be a lot to handle and try to adjust for. From my own experience playing and coaching, goaltenders begin to play differently across all situations when they find themselves more regularly facing more challenging and complicated situations.
Now Hart isn’t the only goalie to see significant performance drop offs when their Total Danger increased significantly (>10% jumps in Total Danger) from one season to another. We don’t need to look much farther than the Calgary Flames goalies from this year. Between the 2022 and 2023 season, Dan Vladar’s Total Danger jumped from 34.85 to 47.62, while Jacob Markstrom’s jumped from 38.74 to 51.13. In 2023, both Vladar and Markstrom saw roughly 3 less low danger shots per game and found themselves facing 1.5 more high and medium danger shots per game. The same thing can be said about goalies like Ilya Samsonov and Jake Allen between 2021 and 2022. Where this becomes interesting is when goalies aren’t affected by significant jumps year to year. When you start looking at this list of goalies, you once again find yourself reading the same names: Juuse Saros, Ilya Sorokin, Igor Shesterkin and of course as we all expected, Darcy Kuemper. This may be where we start to see some of the “elite” goalies appear, in the space where they experience a pretty big deviation of shot difficulty from normal and have the ability to withstand it, while also demonstrating good performances at lower levels of difficulty. 
While Total Danger is something to consider when evaluating performance, it ultimately still remains a fairly superficial idea. Like how each shot is not equal in general, each high danger shot is not equal either. It may just help us identify a slightly different lens for looking at game difficulty, rather than strictly using expected goals. I’ll wrap this summary up with two things. First, an appreciation for Thatcher Demko’s 2020 season, where he had a Total Danger of 55.7 (league average was 40.35), and a penalty kill total danger of 187.35 (while the league average for goalies who faced over 40 penalty kill minutes was 76.30). Thatcher Demko’s Total Danger experienced on the penalty kill was 5 standard deviations above league average, which is something I can’t quite wrap my head around. Secondly, the last graph below shows all goaltenders (minimum 500 minutes per season) and their Total Danger compared to their standard save percentage.

So is goaltending voodoo? Maybe, maybe not. Some of the trends can be partially explained by changes in the shot quality that goalies face, which in turn reflect both offensive player decisions and team defensive strategies. What a goalie sees and what they respond to tells us information about the goalie themselves, but also provides insight into what the team may be responsible for. Hockey media, teams, and fan bases may just be too quick to label a goaltender as elite, and instead fail to appreciate that repeated and reproducible results are difficult to find. 
This leaves us with Carter Hart, the case study for this look into the idea of Total Danger. He sees a jump in 2021 (and a big one on the PK), he struggles for a season, and adjusts back to his usual self in 2022 and 2023. Is his usual self the elite top 5 goaltender people projected him to be? That I don’t know. Goaltenders exist in vacuums of small sample sizes and variance, and that will forever remain a problem that people need to wrestle with. For now, we’ll have to wait and see.
